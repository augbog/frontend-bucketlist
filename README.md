# frontend-bucketlist
A bucket list of things that every Frontend Engineer should make at least once in their lives. I've seen a lot of companies asking their engineers to build things.

In general, I feel building something from the ground up has a lot of value and in many ways is far more informative than a technical interview. In truth, there are a lot of projects I've always wanted to make. It doesn't really matter how you make them -- the journey is what is important here.

So I wanted to start this list in the hopes that, maybe, I can complete all these things. The demand for Frontend Engineers is constantly growing and so are the expectations. I encourage people who love Frontend to try buiding these projects, documenting the gotchas, and submitting their experiences.
